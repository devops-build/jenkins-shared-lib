Spike: shared shell scripts in jenkins shared libs

Shared jenkins library which should be vired up as per [documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/)

Idea with this was to have shared shell and groovy scripts to be kept in the library which could be used across multiple projects.
